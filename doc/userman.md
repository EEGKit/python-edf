Notes on usage
--------------
When opening some edf files created by some companies software, I get "IOError: malloc error" returned. This seems to be because the headers are malformed. If I run Teuniz's edfbrowser software and use the header editor and save the result. 
I can then open the files with edf reader without difficulty.
