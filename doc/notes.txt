So far
------
- edflib.[ch] compile. Thank you Teunis!
- start doing tests from cpython, can open sample 
- create list of constants in edf.pxi
- use gccxml and xml2cython to get an initial template for _edflib.pxd
  * looks like most functions and structs are wrapped
- got compilation going with direct linkage of edflib.o under windows 7 + VC9
  (see setup-win64.py)


- it is possible to build python 2.7 extensions with setupegg.py develop and MS compiler free release for python2.7  on windows (autodetected!) 2016-05

How to distribute
-----------------
- see https://packaging.python.org/
# binary wheels build
python setup.py bdist_wheel

# upload using twine
- first setup ~/.pypirc correctly

# as of 2018-09-30 still using legacy upload

# test upload
twine upload -r testpypi dist/*

# if looks ok then upload to real pypi
twine upload -r legacypypi dist/*

To do
-----
- start on low-level interface to functions
- probably will start with a single buffer, allocated and reallocated as needed to pass the data in as physical measurements via numpy array
- will leave open lower level interface to underlying data
- accessors for patient information
